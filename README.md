# E-Commerce Platform DevOps Mastery Suite: My GitLab CI and Ansible Integration Journey

## Overview

In this project, I'm sharing my journey of integrating GitLab CI and Ansible for automating the deployment of a sample e-commerce web application. This suite aims to provide hands-on experience with building a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline that ensures scalability, security, and efficiency.

## Project Goals
- **Automate Deployment**:

 I'll be using GitLab CI for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of the application.
- **Configuration Management**: 

I'll utilize Ansible for managing application configurations and environments.
- **Security Integration**: 

I'll implement security best practices using tools like Checkmarx, ZAP, and Trivy.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: 

I'll integrate monitoring and logging solutions using Datadog and Splunk.
- **Automated Testing**: 

I'll include Selenium for UI testing and JUnit for unit testing to ensure code quality.

## Architecture
The project architecture consists of the following components:
- **GitLab CI**: For automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and environment provisioning.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Kubernetes (EKS)**: For orchestrating the deployment of Docker containers.
- **Checkmarx, ZAP, Trivy**: For static and dynamic application security testing (SAST and DAST).
- **Datadog**: For monitoring and logging.
- **Selenium, JUnit**: For automated UI and unit testing.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- GitLab account and repository setup
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Ansible installed
- Kubernetes cluster (EKS) setup
- Datadog setup for monitoring and logging
- Selenium and JUnit setup for automated testing

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-mastery-suite.git
    cd devops-mastery-suite
    ```

2. **Configure Ansible**
    - Update `ansible/playbooks/setup.yml` with your server details.
    - Update `ansible/playbooks/deploy.yml` for application deployment specifics.

3. **Build and Push Docker Images**
    ```sh
    cd docker
    docker build -t yourusername/yourapp:latest .
    docker push yourusername/yourapp:latest
    ```

4. **Configure GitLab CI**
    - Update `.gitlab-ci.yml` with your project specifics.
    - Ensure GitLab runners are configured to run the CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yml
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yml
    ```

6. **Setup Monitoring and Logging**
    - Deploy Datadog and Splunk using the provided configurations.
    - Integrate Datadog and Splunk for comprehensive monitoring and logging.

7. **Automated Testing**
    - Configure Selenium for UI tests in `tests/selenium_tests/test_ui.py`.
    - Configure JUnit for unit tests in `tests/junit_tests/TestApp.java`.

### Running the Pipeline
- Push your changes to the GitLab repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor the pipeline execution on GitLab and ensure all stages pass successfully.

ðŸ’¡ This project showcases the integration of GitLab CI and Ansible for an e-commerce platform, emphasizing security, automation, and monitoring to build a robust DevOps pipeline.
